# Python-Based Species Classification Wireless Camera for Forest Survey and Monitoring


## Working
1. Create a wireless camera prototype for species classification that will aid in the monitoring and surveillance of forests.
2. TensorFlow models have already been trained are used in our smart camera's Python-based programming.
3. We match and map the picture in the frame with the training data of the pre-trained tensor models to detect the image in the frame.
4. A Raspberry Pi equipped with a camera module was utilized.
5. The Raspberry Pi uses its camera to capture the footage, which it then frames splits using the OpenCV package. 
6. Then, it processes the image recognition of the species in the picture using OpenCV and other modules and tries to map it with a category and trained detection model. 7. The discovered species' outcome is then displayed.
