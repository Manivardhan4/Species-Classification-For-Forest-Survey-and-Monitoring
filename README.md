# Python-Based Species Classification Wireless Camera for Forest Survey and Monitoring


## Working
-> Create a wireless camera prototype for species classification that will aid in the monitoring and surveillance of forests.
-> TensorFlow models have already been trained are used in our smart camera's Python-based programming.
-> We match and map the picture in the frame with the training data of the pre-trained tensor models to detect the image in the frame.
-> A Raspberry Pi equipped with a camera module was utilized.
-> The Raspberry Pi uses its camera to capture the footage, which it then frames splits using the OpenCV package. 
-> Then, it processes the image recognition of the species in the picture using OpenCV and other modules and tries to map it with a category and trained detection model. -> The discovered species' outcome is then displayed.
